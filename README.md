# SHORK Mini

A minimal Linux distribution originally based on [FLOPPINUX's](https://github.com/w84death/floppinux) build instructions, but developed into something more automated and tailored for my usage. The aim is to produce an operating system that is very lean but functional for PCs with 486SX-class or better processors, specifically with my '90s IBM ThinkPads in mind. Whilst FLOPPINUX and [Action Retro's video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiHZbnFrHOY) provided a great basis to start with and inspired me, the SHORK Mini does not offer a floppy diskette image. A raw disk drive image is built instead, as my scope includes more utilities and functionality. This repo stores my ideal configurations and largely automates the build and compilation process.

## Usage

Please read "Notice & disclaimers" at the end of this readme before proceeding.

### Native compilation

If you are using an Arch or Debian-based Linux, run `build.sh` whilst in the `shorkmini` directory and answer any prompts given throughout the process. Script parameters are listed in the "Scripts" section of this readme that can be used to reduce the need for the aforementioned prompts.

### Dockerised compilation

If you are using Windows, macOS, a Linux distribution that has not been tested with native compilation, or want some kind of "sandbox" on this process, you can try Dockerised compilation instead. It will create a Docker container with a minimal Debian 13 installation that is active for just the lifetime of the build process. Run `docker-compose up` whilst in this repository's directory (not `shorkmini`).

## Capabilities

### Included BusyBox commands

* **Core & text:** awk, basename, cat, chmod, chown, clear, cp, cut, date, echo, find, grep, less, ls, man, mkdir, mv, printf, pwd, readlink, rm, rmdir, sed, tee, test, touch, uname, vi, which

* **Networking:** ftpget, ftpput, hostname, ifconfig, ping, route, udhcpc, wget

* **System & processes:** chroot, crontab, free, kill, mknod, mount, nohup, pkill, sleep, sync, top, umount

* **Other:** beep, showkey

### Included software

* ftp (FTP client, tnftp)
* nano (text editor)
* scp (SCP client, Dropbear)
* ssh (SSH client, Dropbear)

### Included custom utilities 

* shorkcol (changes terminal foreground colour)
* shorkfetch (displays basic system and environment info)
* shorkhelp (shows a command, software & utilities list)

## Overall process

1. Installs needed packages on the host system (user is prompted to choose Arch or Debian-based).
2. An i486 musl cross-compiler is downloaded and extracted.
3. ncurses source is downloaded and compiled. This is a prerequisite for other program compilations (e.g., nano).
4. Linux kernel source is downloaded and compiled. `configs/linux.config` is copied during this process. The configuration is tailored to provide the minimum for 486SX, PATA/SATA and networking. The output is `build/bzImage`.
4. BusyBox source is downloaded and compiled. `configs/busybox.config` is copied during this process. BusyBox provides common Unix-style utilities in one executable.
5. BusyBox's compilation is used to assemble a root file system in `build/root`. All files in `sysfiles` are copied into their appropriate locations.
6. Any other programs I desire are downloaded and compiled. Currently, this includes: nano, tnftp and Dropbear.
7. A raw hard drive image is created, containing the kernel image and the aforementioned file system.
8. `qemu-img` is used to create a copy that is converted to VMware format (`.vmdk`) for testing.

## Scripts

* `build.sh`: Contains the complete download and compilation process that reproduces a `shorkmini.img` disk drive image.

    * `-ab` and `--always-build` parameter can be used to ensure the kernel is always (re)built. This will skip the prompt that appears if the kernel is already downloaded and built, acting like the user selected the "Reset & clean" option.
        * This does nothing if the "skip kernel" parameter is also used.
    * `-m` and `--minimal` parameters can be used to skip to assembling the file system. This is useful if you want to rebuild the disk drive image after only making changes to `sysfiles`.
        * **This requires at least one complete run through before this works.**
    * `-sp` and `--skip-prerequisites` parameters can be used to skip downloading host system prerequisite packages.
        * **This requires at least one complete run through before this works.**
    * `-sk` and `--skip-kernel` parameters can be used to skip downloading and compiling the kernel.
        * **This requires at least one complete run through before this works.**
    * `-sb` and `--skip-busybox` parameters can be used to skip downloading and compiling BusyBox.
        * **This requires at least one complete run through before this works.**

* `clean.sh`: Deletes anything that was downloaded, created or generated by `build.sh`.

* `common.sh`: Contains some useful variables and functions for `build.sh`. This does nothing if you try to execute it.

## Directories

* `configs`: Contains my Linux kernel and BusyBox `.config` files that are copied into their respective source code directories before compilation, and a helper when compiling a binary that should be static not dynamic.

* `sysfiles`: Contains important system files to be copied into the Linux root file system before zipping.

## Running

### Real hardware

TODO.

### 86Box

86Box should be able to create many vintage machine configurations to test with. Below is a suggested configuration for the lowest-end machine SHORK Mini should be able to run on:

* Machine
    * **Machine type:** [1994] i486 (Socket 3 PCI)
    * **Machine:** [i420EX] Intel Classic/PCI ED (Ninja)
    * **CPU type:** Intel i486SX
    * **Frequency:** any option
    * **FPU:** any option
    * **Memory:** at least 24 MB
* Display
    * **Video:** [ISA] IBM VGA
* Input
    * **Keyboard:** AT Keyboard
* Network
    * Network Card #1
        * **Mode:** SLiRP
        * **Adapter:** [ISA16] AMD PCnet-ISA
* Storage controllers
    * Hard disk
        * **Controller 1:** Internal device
* Hard disks
    * Existing...
        * **Bus:** IDE
        * **Channel:** 0:0
        * **Model:** any [Generic] should be fine

You can configure sound, ports, floppy and CD-ROM drives however you wish. Just avoid any SCSI components.

### VMware Workstation

SHORK Mini should work with VMware Workstation without issue. Below is a suggested virtual machine configuration:

* **Hardware compatibility:** any option
* **Install operating system from:** later
* **Guest Operating System:** Linux (Other Linux 6.x kernel)
* **Number of processers:** 1
* **Number of cores per processor:** 1 (technically any option, extra will not be utilised)
* **Memory:** at least 24MB
* **Network Connection:** any option (only NAT presently tested though)
* **I/O Controller Types:** BusLogic
* **Virtual Disk Type:** IDE
* **Disk:** Use an existing virtual disk


## Notice & disclaimers

Running `build.sh` for native compilation will automatically perform several tasks on the host computer and operating system, including enabling 32-bit packages (Debian), installing prerequisite packages, modifying PATH, and creating some environment variables. If you intend to use this yourself, please note that this is tailored for my personal usage. Please review what the script does to ensure it does not conflict with your existing configuration. Alternatively, consider Dockerised compilation to minimise impact to your host operating system.

Running `clean.sh` will delete everything `build.sh` has downloaded, created or generated, including the `build` folder and its contents. `.gitingore` indicates what would be deleted. If you made any manual changes to or in a file or directory covered by that, they will be lost.
