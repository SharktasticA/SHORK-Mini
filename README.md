# SHORK Mini

A minimal Linux distribution developed originally from [FLOPPINUX's](https://github.com/w84death/floppinux) instructions. The aim is to make something very lean but functional for my mid-'90s IBM ThinkPads. I'm not necessarily aiming to restrict myself to a floppy diskette's size, so this is already above 1.44MB. FLOPPINUX was a neat basis to start with, though. This repo stores my ideal configurations and largely automates the setup and compilation process.

## Scripts

* `setup.sh`: Contains the complete download and compilation process that reproduces a `shorkmini.img` file to use.

* `clean.sh`: Deletes anything that is downloaded, created or generated by `setup.sh`.

* `common.sh`: Contains some useful variables and functions for `setup.sh`. This does nothing if you try to execute it.

## Directories

* `configs`: My Linux kernel and BusyBox `.config` files that are copied into their respective source code directories before compilation.

* `sysfiles`: Important files to be copied into the Linux file system before zipping.

## Usage

On Arch-based or Debian-based Linux, just run `setup.sh`. Once it has finished, a `build` directory with a `shorkmini.img` file inside should be present and ready to use.

## Notice & disclaimers

Running `setup.sh` will automatically perform several tasks on the host computer, including enabling 32-bit packages (Debian), installing prerequisite packages, modifying the PATH, and creating some environment variables. If you intend to use this yourself, please note that this is tailored for my personal usage. Please review what the script does to ensure it does not conflict with your existing configuration.

Running `clean.sh` will delete everything `setup.sh` made, including the `build` folder and its contents.
